<h1>About Us</h1>
<h4>As children continue to grow, keeping up with their education becomes increasingly challenging. As expected, this does have a significantly large impact on mental health. Students are loaded with tons of work each day, with that, they are expected to prepare for exams, summatives, progress checks and still manage to stay positive and healthy. They are meant to plan their future, their college, their career. It is evidently difficult to cope with this kind of pressure. Around the world, 10-20% of adolescents suffer from mental health disorders. Effects can include - increased anxiety levels, reduced concentration, excessive worrying, anger, constant mood swings, low energy, inconsistency in sleeping, paranoia, detachment from friends and family or major changes in eating habits.</h4>
<h4>This is where the concept of music therapy becomes essential. Not only does music relieve mental pressure so that you can concentrate on your studies, it also helps students study better. Positive effects of music on academics are explored through how humans advance. Examples of this include - increased memory, better reading and literary skills, spatial-tempered reasoning, emotional intelligence and stronger cognitive thinking.<h4>

<h1 >Music and the Brain</h1>
<h4>When music leaves sound systems and stereos as sound waves, the vibrations that reach our ears are transformed into electrical signals which are carried to the brain by nerve cells called neurons. When these signals reach the cerebral cortex, different parts of the brain react differently. The motor cortex and cerebellum are responsible for movements and dancing, the auditory cortex perceives and analyses sounds whereas the nucleus accumbens and amygdala are responsible for emotional reactions. Since we are all born with more neurons in our brain than necessary, at the age of eight, neurons that are not needed are removed, thus making it easier to teach music to younger children as they can perceive and understand it better. When music is taught to young children, it will stay with them forever.</h4>
<h4>Moreover, playing different instruments can help cultivate a person’s skill set. Concentration, memory and attention are all tested as you coordinate using various parts of your body while learning to read musical notations. This helps engage and energise different parts of the brain like the motor and auditory cortex.</h4>
<h4>Due to this, it is vital that music is incorporated into the daily lives of children, through either the school curriculum or out-of-school activities. Playing and listening to music consistently has multiple benefits to it which are unrelated to academics. Research proves that it can help stimulate memories, relieve symptoms of depression or anxiety, boost your immune system, make you a better communicator and help reduce overall stress, among other advantages which can help adolescents lead a better lifestyle.</h4>

<h1>Mental Health and Academics</h1>
<h4>As mentioned earlier, mental health is the representation of well-being. Studies have shown that mental health can impact a student’s academic performance and academics can impact one’s well-being. Disadvantages of academics in relation to one’s mental health is simply the fact that academic pressure caused by exams and grades can lead to mental diseases (such as anxiety, fear, paranoia, low self-esteem and more). Generally, the workload begins to increase during highschool (between the ages of 14 to 17). This is when most students start to stress and over think. Educational institutes do what they can to prevent the formation of mental diseases, however, they are unable to do much. Students are terrified for themselves, for their future, for how people will react to their grades and how they will feel when they do not do as well as they expected. It begins to get especially hard if the student fails to have a positive group of people to support them, like friends and family. Although, the pressure can be harmful, if directed in the right direction, can help avoid mental diseases and has also shown to enhance academic performance.</h4>
<h4>It is important to note that education definitely has a bad impact on mental health and this kind of pressure should be avoided at all costs but it is also significant to understand that education has a healthy effect too. The more knowledge a student has, the easier it is for them to interpret and solve everyday problems. It is easier for them when they know what to do or know how to get to the solution. This benefit of using facts to stimulate the brain to calm down is essential for not only student life, but is a good privilege to have even when one grows into an adult. Not only can one interpret situations better, education also helps strengthen cognitive thinking and memory with the progress checks taken often. This can lead to better problem solving. The idea of socio-economic stability also is a strong factor because an educated person has a lower chance of facing financial problems, this can decrease the anxiety or the stress children have for their future hence resulting in a more calm mental state. This is just a mention of the fact that academics is essential and must be valued even though it seems to have a negative impact on one’s mental health often.</h4>
<h4>This leads to the next aspect of their relationship. How does mental health impact education? Better mental health has been proven to have more focused learning, stronger level of creativity and less procrastination. With a positive mindset, one is more likely to thrive in their academic environment. It is essential to protect one’s mental health so that the student can develop in the best way possible.</h4>
<h4>On the other hand, mental illnesses have clear academic drawbacks. A bad mental health can lead to more distractions which could cause a student to lose focus, it can reduce or slow the rate of brain activity and can lead to memory loss, which are all harmful to one’s education and future. Thus, it is necessary to employ strategies such as music to stimulate one’s brain to be in a peaceful state for better academic results. This is something the founders of the orchid project believe will make the students thrive and hence must be incorporated as soon as possible.</h4>

<h1>The future of the project</h1>
<h4>We plan to teach people the importance of music so they can incorporate it in their daily lives to elevate their mood. Underprivileged children and school students will be our main focus since they are often the people most under stress. 
We would like to take the project forward in different stages, by organising different workshops and activities over the next few months through the leadership programme.

    </div>
    <p class="mb-1">After presenting in school and observing the impact, we would like to move further and expand our reach by creating similar workshops in different schools in Delhi for children around the ages of 9-16 to help them gain knowledge about music and mental health. </p>

    <p class="mb-1">We would also like to work on an entertainment based workshop, where we will play live or pre-recorded music (depending on the pandemic) for underprivileged children through NGOs and government aided schools for entertainment purposes. This can help engage the audience, helping them understand the importance of music in a fun and stimulating manner. </p>

      <h5 class="mb-1">Step 4</h5>
    </div>
    <p class="mb-1">In old age homes, we can create small entertainment sessions which would include music and dance performances, during the festival season like Diwali. We can provide continuous entertainment by doing a survey to learn their music taste, and then record suitable songs. Furthermore, we can raise money to provide them with devices to listen to music on such as the Caravaan Music Box which comes with preloaded older Indian music.</p>

      <h5 class="mb-1">Step 5</h5>
    </div>
    <p class="mb-1">To help people learn how to play musical instruments, we aim to provide easy to manage instruments such as guitars, ukuleles, small keyboards, harmonicas, flutes or recorders to NGOs and schools teaching music. Through an instrument donation drive in Delhi NCR, we can collect and donate instruments in working condition.</p>

<h4>Throughout the course of this project, we believe we will develop and use different ATL skills which will be very beneficial. We will prosper as thinkers as we contemplate and consider the different ways we can spread awareness and reach underprivileged children, as well as our peers in class. Furthermore, we will become more reflective and caring as we work with people who require our help, simultaneously developing communicative skills as we interact with new people. Moreover, we will progress as more knowledgeable people because we will learn new things about our community and society through this project where we plan to collaborate and educate individuals around us. </h4>
<h4>In summation, we as students have the experience and understand the pressure of education and our future careers and we would like to employ the positive effects of music on our brain to help other students around us. The project is planned in such a way that no student’s career and future education will be impacted. We are simply trying to spread as much positivity as we can in hard times that students like us need to battle through every single day. Music is a resource which can change an entire generation’s attitude towards education and school. In ancient Greece, people would use orchids as an ingredient to form elixir which would supposedly provide them with the power and strength hence the the founders of this project, students of The British School, aim to use this project as an elixir to provide motivation and joy to students in order to make sure that they achieve their best in the most significant years of their life.</h4>
