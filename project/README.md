# The Orchid Project
#### Video Demo:  [link](https://youtu.be/sZxPcfeim2I)
#### Description:
The Orchid Project is a project I have been working on since the past year. 
This website was to aid the project's impact and use technology to its maximum. 
It aims to help students like me cope with their academic environment by equipping their auditory senses in a way which helps them.
The Orchid Project was started as a social initiative by us, students who have experienced the mentioned effects and are willing to help other students who are unaware of this aspect of music and mental health. We believe we can help a lot of students to do their absolute best if they are willing to employ our strategies. We have created awareness accounts on social media and have designed playlists for students who have access to devices to use while studying. 
The static files included: [0001.jpg](static/0001.jpg), [anxiety.jpg](static/anxiety.jpg), [burnout.jpg](static/burnout.jpg), [ed.jpg](static/ed.jpg), [ptsd.jpg](static/ptsd.jpg), [sa.jpg](static/sa.jpg)
The templates: [aboutus.html](templates/aboutus.html), [form-playlist.html](templates/form-playlist.html), [guides.html](templates/guides.html), [index.html](templates/index.html), [journal.html](templates/journal.html), [journalled.html](templates/journalled.html), [layout.html](templates/layout.html), [login.html](templates/login.html), [register.html](templates/register.html)
The website will open at the login page, if you have not signed in it will ask the user to register. once regustered it will redirect the user to the login page where the user can enter the homepageof the website. 
In the navbar on the homepage there are six pages to enter:
- home 
- about us 
- find a playlist
- journal
- self check in 
- logout 

##### Homepage:
The homepage consists of a brief description of this project and what we aim to do, a brief introduction perhaps. 
##### About Us:
In the about us page, there is a discussion about music's impact on the brain and hard facts about the purpose and value of the idea. It talks about music's impact on the brain, mental health's impact on a students academic success and the future of the project. 
##### Find a Playlist:
After a lot of research i have understood what kind of people listen to what kind of music and based a form which gives me enough information to recommend playlists to the user whcih my partner in the project and I have made for this project. the user is asked to answer 8 questions and based on that are given multiple playlists.
##### Journal:
As I understand that music is significant in terms of the brain's growth, being able to jot down what you are feeling is a strong method to a better well being too. Thereby I have created a section where the user can jorunal in every morning and plan their day out leaving them much more relaxed than usual. Once they are done, they are prompted with a motivating alert to help them force themselves to journal everyday.
##### Self Check In:
Self check in is a safe place for the user to self diagnose any of the five major mental health diseases - anxiety, eating disorders, substant abuse, ptsd and burning out STudents face many for these problems everyday and are still struggling.

This website is personal to me because I, as a student have undergone a lot of anxietyand have used music to help me survive. My colleague from school helped me with bits of the information thereby I would like to give her credit - Samiha Vashisth. 


This web application was made through a compilation of python, flask, sql and javascript.
